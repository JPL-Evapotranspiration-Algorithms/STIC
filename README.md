# Surface Temperature Initiated Closure (STIC) Evapotranspiration Model Python Implementation

[![CI](https://github.com/JPL-Evapotranspiration-Algorithms/STIC/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JPL-Evapotranspiration-Algorithms/STIC/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This repository contains the python implementation for the Surface Temperature Initiated Closure (STIC) evapotranspiration model, used by the ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) and Surface Biology and Geology (SBG) missions.

This software package is a Python implementation of the Surface Temperature Initiated Closure (STIC) version 1.3 model designed to implement LST to solve the aerodynamic temperature, which is critical for ET modeling. The original STIC model produced by Kaniska Mallick (Mallick et al. 2015; 2018; 2022) was re-implemented from MATLAB code to Python by Gregory Halverson and Madeleine Pascolini-Campbell. The software was developed under a research grant by the NASA Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) program. It is intended for use by the Hyperspectral Thermal Emission Spectrometer (HyTES), MODIS/ASTER (MASTER) Airborne Simulator, Ecosystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission and as a precursor for the Surface Biology and Geology (SBG) mission. 

The software was developed as part of a research grant by the NASA Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) program. It was designed for use by the Hyperspectral Thermal Emission Spectrometer (HyTES), MODIS/ASTER (MASTER) Airborne Simulator, Ecosystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission as a precursor for the Surface Biology and Geology (SBG) mission. It may also be useful for general remote sensing and GIS projects in Python. This package can be utilized for remote sensing research in Jupyter notebooks and deployed for operations in data processing pipelines.
 
The software is being released according to the SPD-41 open-science requirements of NASA-funded ROSES projects.

## Installation

Use the pip package manager to install the `STIC` PyPi package.

```
pip install STIC
```

## Usage

Import the `STIC` function from the `STIC` package.

```
from STIC import STIC
```

See the [ECOSTRESS example](ECOSTRESS%20Example.ipynb) for usage.
